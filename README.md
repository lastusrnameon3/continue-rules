# Clause-Skillz

Rules, skills, hooks, and workflow standards for AI-assisted infrastructure engineering.

> **Status.** This repo began as `continue-rules`, targeting the Continue extension for VS Code.
> Continue reached end of life at 2.0.0. The system is migrating to **Claude Code, personal scope**:
> everything installs to `~/.claude/` and nothing is committed into work repos.
> `.continue/` is kept as the archived v2.0.0 artifact — it is not maintained.

## Structure

```
Clause-Skillz/
  claude/
    rules/          ← 13 rules: universal (00-04) + path-scoped domain (10-17)
    skills/         ← 6 invokable skills
    hooks/          ← 4 enforced lifecycle hooks
    settings.json
  .continue/        ← ARCHIVED. Continue v2.0.0. Not maintained.
  .vscode/          ← Shared editor settings and snippets
  scripts/          ← Machine bootstrap
  STATE.md          ← Project state file (session continuity)
  BOUNDARY-DEFINITION.md
```

## Install — personal scope

```bash
./scripts/Setup-Machine.sh          # or Setup-Machine.ps1 on Windows
cp -r claude/rules claude/skills claude/hooks claude/settings.json ~/.claude/
```

`Setup-Machine` configures `git config --global core.excludesfile` so `.claude/`, `CLAUDE.md`, and
`CLAUDE.local.md` are ignored in every repo — **without** a committed `.gitignore` entry, which would
itself disclose the tooling. Run it once per machine; it is idempotent.

Verify: `/context` in any repo lists the five universal rules under **Memory files**. Open a `.ps1`
and `10-code` appears; open a `.md` and it does not.

Requires `jq` and bash. Git Bash satisfies both on Windows.

## Rules — layered model

Rules load from frontmatter. No manual invocation.

**Universal — every session** (no `paths:` field):

- `00-project-context` — reads STATE.md, project template stub
- `01-me` — behavioral defaults (audit first, simpler option, direct feedback)
- `02-thinking` — adversarial defaults (challenge before building)
- `03-writing` — README standard + session summary format
- `04-tool-delegation` — context-efficient tool output handling

**Domain — only when a matching file is in context** (`paths:` glob):

- `10-code` — code standards (`.ps1`, `.py`, `.sh`, `.js`, `.ts`)
- `11-security` — credential, certificate, and secret handling
- `12-git-workflow` — commit format, MR/PR standards
- `13`–`16` — deployment checklists (shared, Windows, Linux, Python)
- `17-documentation-ste` — Simplified Technical English for `DEPLOYMENT-*.md`

## Skills — `/name`

| Skill | Invoked by | Modes |
|---|---|---|
| `/review-lens` | you | infra · teamlead · architect · blindspot · sidebiz · community |
| `/challenge` | you | challenge · premortem · steelman · tradeoff · breakit |
| `/security-review` | **you or Claude** | — |
| `/userdocs` | you | — |
| `/jira` | you | — |
| `/plainify` | you | names · comments · both |

`security-review` is the only model-invocable skill: it should fire on its own when credential-shaped
work appears. Everything else is a deliberate invocation.

Not rebuilt here — already installed as Claude skills: terse-mode · context-compress · usage-stats ·
quick-reference · commit-message · code-review · session-summary (which owns `/eod`, `/pickup`, `/state`).

## Hooks — the things you would forget

Skills are what you reach for. Hooks run regardless of what you or the model decide.

| Hook | Event | Does |
|---|---|---|
| `session-start` | SessionStart | Injects the latest STATE.md entry. Replaces remembering `/state`. |
| `credential-guard` | PreToolUse `Edit\|Write` | Blocks literal secrets and PEM private keys. |
| `review-gate` | PreToolUse `Bash` (git commit) | One nudge to review, then silent for the session. |
| `eod-reminder` | Stop | Uncommitted changes and no STATE.md entry today → reminds. |

`credential-guard` replaces Continue's content-keyword `regex:` trigger on `11-security`. Continue
could only inject advice; a hook denies the write. It matches value-shaped secrets — keyword plus
assignment plus a 16-character value, or a PEM block — not bare keywords, which is what the
`11-security` context rule is for.

## Where things live — Notion vs this repo

| | Owns | Answers |
|---|---|---|
| **Notion** (Infrastructure Engineering → ⚙️ Clause-Skillz) | Intent, rationale, rejected options, `config.yaml` | **What and why** |
| **This repo** | Rule files, skills, hooks, scripts, `STATE.md` | **How — the working artifacts** |

Behavior questions resolve against the files. Questions about *why* a rule exists, or what was
rejected on the way to it, resolve against Notion. If the same sentence is in both, delete it from
Notion.

`STATE.md` records what changed and why at the commit level. Notion holds the longer-form reasoning
that outlives any single change.

## Distribution

**None.** Personal scope by design — the install is a copy into `~/.claude/` on each machine.

The former `git subtree --prefix .continue/rules` mechanism is retired. It never worked: `subtree`
places the *repo root* at the prefix, so rules landed at `.continue/rules/.continue/rules/*.md`
where nothing looks for them, four frontmatter-less markdown files landed where rules were expected,
and `.continue/prompts/` was never distributed at all.

## Configuration

`config.yaml` is not in this repo — it holds endpoint URLs and key references, and lives in Notion
only. Claude Code needs no equivalent: personal scope means no shared config.
